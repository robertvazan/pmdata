# PMData #

PMData is a framework for reactive data-driven and data science websites. It is built on [Hookless](https://hookless.machinezoo.com/) reactive framework, [PushMode](https://pushmode.machinezoo.com/) HTML streaming library, and [PMSite](https://pmsite.machinezoo.com/) core web framework. [PMSite](https://pmsite.machinezoo.com/) defines technical website structure without constraining content, data, or layout in any way. PMData builds on top of PMSite by adding default layout, styling, widgets, and reactive data sources.
