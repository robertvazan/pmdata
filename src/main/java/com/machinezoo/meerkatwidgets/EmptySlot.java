	 * This functionality can be accomplished in several ways. There's no perfect solution.
	 * We could just remember current position in the SiteFragment and then insert at this position later,
	 * but that would fail when earlier empty widgets get substituted and our insertion point moves.
	 * We can add a marker element (probably TEMPLATE as it has no effect on rendering if left in place),
	 * then search for it and replace it, which would work well while SiteFragment's content is still being updated,
	 * but once SiteFragment's content is consumed (e.g. by merging it into parent SiteFragment)
	 * our writes to SiteFragment's content will not reach the user.
	 * We will have to use auxiliary container element and leave it in generated HTML.
	 * The least semantic elements are DIV and SPAN. Calling code will have to pick the more suitable one.
	 * We can minimize impact on page layout with "display: contents" in CSS.
